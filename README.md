# Rift7

Rift7.com is a platform I have been working on to explore and develop tools related to Cybersecurity and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence). As I learn and grow in these fields, I'll be updating this website with new and useful tools that can aid in security and intelligence gathering. Feel free to browse the website at [https://rift7.com](https://rift7.com) or host it yourself using the instructions below.
